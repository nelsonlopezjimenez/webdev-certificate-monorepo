For learning JavaScript monorepos, consider using a combination of online resources and hands-on practice. Start with understanding the concept of monorepos and their benefits, then explore popular tools like Lerna, Nx, or Turborepo, and finally, build a simple monorepo project to solidify your understanding. 
1. Understanding Monorepos:
Definition:
A monorepo is a single Git repository that contains multiple distinct projects or modules. 
Benefits:
Simplified dependency management. 
Easier sharing of code and libraries across projects. 
Improved collaboration and code reuse. 
Reduced code duplication. 
Key Concepts:
Workspace: The root directory of the monorepo, containing multiple project directories. 
Packages: Individual projects within the monorepo. 
Dependency Management: Managing dependencies between packages. 
2. Popular Monorepo Tools:
Lerna:
A popular tool for managing JavaScript monorepos, especially for projects using npm or Yarn. 
Features include:
Automated version management. 
Easy command execution across multiple packages. 
Git integration for managing the monorepo. 
Nx:
A comprehensive tool for managing JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos, offering a wide range of features. 
Features include:
Workspace analysis and caching. 
Code generation and test runners. 
Plugin architecture for customization. 
Turborepo:
A faster and more performant monorepo tool, particularly well-suited for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. 
Features include:
Incremental build times and caching. 
Fast and easy to configure and use. 
Independent from specific application technologies. 
Yarn Workspaces:
A feature within Yarn that allows for managing multiple packages within a single workspace. 
Features include:
Shared node_modules for all packages. 
Single lockfile for all packages. 
Improved dependency management. 
3. Hands-On Learning:
Set up a simple monorepo:
Start with a small project containing a few packages. 
Use one of the tools mentioned above to manage the monorepo. 
Practice adding, modifying, and deleting packages. 
Experiment with different dependency configurations. 
Build a more complex monorepo:
Create a monorepo for a larger project, perhaps a full-stack application. 
Practice sharing components and libraries between different parts of the application. 
Explore different build processes and CI/CD pipelines. 
4. Resources for Learning:
Online Courses: Frontend Masters and Udemy offer courses on monorepos. 
Documentation: The official documentation for Lerna, Nx, Turborepo, and Yarn provides detailed information on how to set up and use these tools. 
Blogs and Articles: Explore blogs and articles on monorepos, such as the Earthly Blog. 
GitHub Examples: Examine examples of monorepos on GitHub to see how they are structured and managed. 
In summary, learning JavaScript monorepos involves understanding the concept, exploring different tools, and then practicing with a simple project. Start with the basics, then gradually increase the complexity of your projects as you gain experience.
